reasons for open source - simplicity - open  code; good for community, more progress - more eyes on code, flexibility
reasons for proprietary - profit, control, big money donated to good, parts all guaranteed to work together

reasons why a company and an individual might choose one or the other: 
An individual or company might choose open source because it's simpler - they don't have to worry about keeping the code secret. They might also choose to go open source because they want to help out the community and care more about advancement then money. Someone might choose proprietary if they want to make a profit, or if they want to maintain control of the code and don't want anyone else to modify it. They may want to use some of the profits made toward a good cause. 

I would choose open source for a side project because it's simpler than proprietary, and proprietary if I was starting a company because I would probably want to make a profit, and the secrecy of the source code might be essential to that.
